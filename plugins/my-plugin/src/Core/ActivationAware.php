 * Without this the core had to know what every feature needed: it seeded the settings option and
 * asked for a rewrite flush whether or not the plugin had settings or post types. Remove those
 * features with `wpx feature remove` and the core kept doing both - seeding a row nothing reads,
 * and rebuilding the rewrite rules for a plugin that registers none. Neither is visible, and the
 * second is expensive.
 *
 * So each module declares its own. Core calls whatever is listed in config/modules.php and knows
 * nothing about what any of it does; removing the feature removes its activation work with it.
 *
 * The methods are static because activation runs before any module is instantiated - WordPress
 * calls the activation hook on a request where the plugin has only just been loaded.
