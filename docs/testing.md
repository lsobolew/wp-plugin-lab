# Testing

```bash
./bin/wpx test                                    # unit + integration + e2e, everywhere
./bin/wpx test unit --targets=latest              # one suite, one version
./bin/wpx test integration --edition=pro          # with the paid add-on active
./bin/wpx test all --targets=latest               # plus linters and Plugin Check
```

Every run writes a JUnit XML file to `.wplab/results/<target>-<edition>-<suite>.xml`, which is what
the dashboard reads and what CI uploads as an artifact.

## The suites

| Suite | Where it runs | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| `unit` | Container, no database | Pure logic. WordPress functions are stubbed by Brain Monkey, so the suite finishes in well under a second. |
| `integration` | Container, real database | Behaviour against an actual WordPress: post types, meta, REST, options, capabilities. Uses the WordPress core test suite (`WP_UnitTestCase`). |
| `e2e` | Host Node, real browser | The product as a user meets it: admin screens, blocks in the real editor, front-end rendering. Runs once per theme in the sweep. Playwright plus `@wordpress/e2e-test-utils-playwright`. |
| `types` | Host Node | `tsc --noEmit`. Vite only transpiles, so nothing would check the block types without this step. |
| `lint` | Container | PHPCS with WordPress Coding Standards and PHPCompatibility, pinned to the versions in the plugin header. |
| `analyse` | Container | PHPStan level 6 with WordPress stubs. |
| `plugin-check` | Container | The official Plugin Check plugin - the same tool the WordPress.org review team runs. |

## Themes are a test dimension too

For end-to-end runs the theme is part of the combination, because a block meets a very different
environment under a block theme than under a classic one. Result names carry the theme alias
(`latest-free-tt1-e2e`), and `docs/themes.md` explains the configuration.

## Editions are a test dimension

With a paid add-on present, `--edition` decides which plugins are active before the suite runs:

- `--edition=free` activates only the free plugin
- `--edition=pro` activates both
- `--edition=both` (the default) runs each in turn

In the `pro` edition the *free* suite runs again with the add-on active. That is deliberate: it is
how you find out that the add-on broke something in the plugin everybody else is running.

Result names carry the package, so a failure points at the right code:

- `latest-free-integration` - the free plugin, on its own
- `latest-pro-integration` - the free plugin, with the add-on active
- `latest-proaddon-integration` - the add-on's own tests

## Writing tests

**Unit** (`plugins/<slug>/tests/Unit/`): stub what you need with `Brain\Monkey\Functions\when()`.
The bootstrap defines `ABSPATH`, the plugin constants and the WordPress time constants - the last
ones matter because PHP evaluates class constant expressions when the class loads, before any mock
could intervene.

**Integration** (`plugins/<slug>/tests/Integration/`): standard `WP_UnitTestCase` with factories.
One trap worth knowing: the core test suite calls `unregister_all_meta_keys()` before every single
test, so meta registered on `init` is gone by the time your test body runs. Re-register it in
`set_up()` - `ContentTypeTest` shows the pattern.

**E2E** (`tests/e2e/free/` and `tests/e2e/pro/`): specs live at the repository root rather than in
the plugin directory, for two reasons. They exercise a whole running site rather than a package,
and `@wordpress/scripts` installs a second copy of Playwright inside the plugin's `node_modules`
which the two instances cannot reconcile.

## Debugging

```bash
./bin/wpx logs latest                 # container output
tail -f .wplab/logs/wp-latest.log     # WP_DEBUG_LOG
./bin/wpx wp latest -- eval '...'     # poke at a live site
```

PHP errors go to the log, never to the HTTP response. That is not only tidiness: a single warning
printed from `wp-config.php` starts the response before the headers, which stops WordPress from
sending the `Link` header that points at the REST API - and e2e tooling uses that header to find
the API at all.

For step debugging, set `XDEBUG_MODE=debug` and restart the target; Xdebug is already installed in
every image and configured to reach the host on port 9003.
